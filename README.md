# AEGIS: The Safety Route Predictor 🛡️📍

A high-performance Safety Navigation application that uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** to analyze 32,500+ crime records across Bengaluru and predict the safest possible walking or driving paths.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **🔥 Live Safety Heatmap:** Visualizes crime hotspots with high-contrast, scalable geographic markers.
*   **🧠 AI-Scored Routing:** Unlike Google Maps, AEGIS evaluates every meter of a path and ranks alternatives as **FASTEST**, **SAFEST**, or **BALANCED**.
*   **🕹️ Navigation Mode:** 45-degree tilted camera, live compass heading tracking, and real-time GPS progress.
*   **🆓 Fully Open-Source Stack:** Uses OSRM, Nominatim, and Scikit-Learn. **No Google Cloud API keys or billing required!**

## 🛠️ Prerequisites & Setup

### 1. Essential Tools & Extensions
Download and install these before starting:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version)
*   [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/)
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (Or use Docker)
*   **VS Code Extensions:**
    *   `Python` (by Microsoft)
    *   `ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets`
    *   `Tailwind CSS IntelliSense`

## 🏗️ Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone and Enter
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VarshaM2405/AEGIS.git
cd AEGIS
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup (Python & ML)
1.  **Enter the folder:** `cd backend`
2.  **Create Virtual Environment:** `python -m venv venv`
3.  **Activate it:** 
    *   (Windows): `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   (Mac/Linux): `source venv/bin/activate`
4.  **Install Dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5.  **Train the AI Model:** `python train_model.py` (This compiles the Random Forest model from the CSV data)
6.  **Run the Server:** `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure your PostgreSQL service is running. The default credentials are in `database.py`: `aegis_user:aegis_password` on DB `aegis`.
>Or Open Docker for Windows AMD64 (I used this) and kep it open and running

### Step 3: Frontend Setup (React Native & Expo)
1.  **Enter the folder:** `cd ../frontend`
2.  **Install Packages:** `npm install`
3.  **Launch Expo:** `npx expo start`

> [!NOTE]
> The backend URL is now detected automatically (see `src/config.js`): it reuses the same LAN IP your phone already connects to Metro with, so no manual IP editing is needed. This only works when the backend and Metro run on the same machine (the setup above). If they don't — e.g. backend on another machine, or an emulator that needs a different address — create a `.env` file in `frontend/` with `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_HOST=<ip-or-host>` to override it.

## 📱 How to View the Output

1.  Download the **Expo Go** app on your physical iPhone or Android device.
2.  Ensure your phone is on the **same Wi-Fi** as your laptop.
3.  Scan the **QR Code** displayed in your terminal.
4.  **Experience:** Go to "Plan Route," search for a location in Bangalore, and select the **Green (Safest)** path to begin navigation!
